        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The use of alcoholic beverages is very common among those who pass through adolescence and adulthood. Despite laws that prohibit children under the age of 18 from consuming alcohol, many still manage to drink. As of 2022-2023, 31% of the population aged 14 years and over use alcoholic beverages in Australia. Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious health issues, including Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), which accounted for 1,742 deaths in Australia in 2022. This website aims to promote health by encouraging moderate alcohol use and raising awareness about the impacts of AUD.</p>

                <h3>Investigation Methods</h3>
                <p>Research gathered from basic to advanced knowledge of alcoholic beverage users comes from secondary sources such as government health websites. Primary data was also collected through a self-created survey sent to everyone 18 years and older in the school to gather evidence on alcohol use frequency, health impacts, and other negative effects. By comparing different sources and statistical data, we aim to determine if Australia has higher rates of AUD compared to the rest of the world and identify the typical negative health impacts.</p>

                <h3>Symptoms and Background Information</h3>
                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a medical condition marked by an inability to stop or control alcohol consumption despite negative consequences. Factors influencing AUD include gender, medical conditions, mental and physical health, and the use of other substances. Alcohol affects the brain quickly, leading to mood changes, impaired judgement, and potential mental health issues like depression and anxiety. Long-term effects include alcoholism, cancer, liver disease, heart problems, stroke, dementia, and psychosis, which can lead to self-harm and suicide.</p>

                <h3>Scale and Trends</h3>
                <p>By 2022, 26.8% of Australian adults exceeded alcohol guidelines. Women were less likely than men to exceed these guidelines (18.1% versus 35.8%). Among young adults aged 18-24, 36.1% exceeded the guidelines. Alcohol was the primary drug of interest in over 40% of treatment sessions in 2022-23. Hospitalizations and deaths due to alcohol-related injuries remain significant, with Tasmania, Queensland, and New South Wales reporting higher rates of alcohol-related deaths than the national average. In 2022, there were 1,742 alcohol-related deaths in Australia.</p>
